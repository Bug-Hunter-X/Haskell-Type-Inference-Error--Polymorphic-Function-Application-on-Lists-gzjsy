This repository demonstrates a common type inference error in Haskell when working with polymorphic functions and lists. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which fails to compile due to type mismatches.  The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version illustrating how to handle this scenario correctly using appropriate type annotations or function specialization.
